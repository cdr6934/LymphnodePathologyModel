# LymphnodePathologyModel

The following repo holds Week 3 CNN Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project

The goal of this project is to develop a binary CNN classifier using the PCam dataset to accurately identify the presence or absence of metastatic tissue in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Metastatic tissue detection plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and staging, and automating this process using deep learning techniques can assist pathologists in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.

The PCam dataset consists of histopathologic scans of lymph node sections, where each image is labeled as either containing metastatic tissue or not. The dataset provides a challenging task due to the high variability in the appearance of metastatic tissue and the presence of complex background structures.
